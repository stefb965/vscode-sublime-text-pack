# Sublime Text Extension Pack

If you are coming from Sublime Text, this extension pack adds functionality for keyboard shortcuts and commands that are missing in VS Code. 

Also, add these settings to get a minimap, format on paste, and snippet suggestions. 

```json
"editor.minimap.enabled": true
"editor.formatOnPaste": true
"editor.snippetSuggestions": "top"
```

## Sublime Text Keymap 

Marketplace - [Sublime Text Keymap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.sublime-keybindings)

Author - [Microsoft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=publisher%3A%22Microsoft%22&target=VSCode)

Ports common keyboard shortcuts from Sublime Text to VS Code. Note that there are some conflicts with VS Code and Sublime Text keyboard shortcuts. Currently the extension chooses Sublime Text's shortcut over VS Code's. This means that some VS Code keyboard shortcuts don't work the same (ex. <kbd>F5</kbd> to debug). You can easily modify this yourself in `Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts`.

## Expand Selection To Scope

VS Code has support in this area, but this extension nails a nice sweet spot. Expand your selection to the scope incrementally, including for multiple cursors.
